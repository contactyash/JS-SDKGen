# SDKGen
SDKGen is Javascript API SDK Code generator, based on json file generated for api docs by Swagger or Goland or optionally your own json file with any shape with transform function. It just requires a apidoc definition (swagger/godac style supported now) and it generates the Javascript SDK for you. It can run in both browser(a tool can be made) and node.
